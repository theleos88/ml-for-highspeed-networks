This directory contains some explorative experimental results related to the high-speed [OpenNetVM platform](https://github.com/sdnfv/openNetVM) on a COTS server.

The experiments include 4 different Service Function Chaining (SFC) settings:

1. Linear 
2. DAG 
3. DAG-2
4. Tree

We conduct two types of experiments:

1. Load stimulus: Perturbing the input traffic with different input rates and traffic patterns. 

2. Resource stimulus: Perturbing the allocated resource to individual VNFs. Currently, we assign collocated parasite processes to each VNF to purturb its CPU share. 

Please refer to each directory for further details.
